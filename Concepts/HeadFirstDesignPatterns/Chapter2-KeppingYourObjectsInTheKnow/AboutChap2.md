# Chapter 2

Here Everything is about the observer Pattern.


## Nice to know:
- Java has its own implementation of Subject and Observer. There the mapping is:
    Subject = Observable
    Observer = Observer

-  There is a lot of functionality you can directly use out of the box.
- You can define if you want to pull or to push the data.
